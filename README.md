# Numerical Solution for 1-D Schrödinger’s Wave Equation
Quantum Physics, unlike the Classical Physics, describes the behavior of the matter and light (photons) on the atomic and subatomic level. It is heavily based on the mathematical models which attempt to describe and account for the properties of atoms and their constituents. Schrödinger Equation, also known as Schrödinger’s Wave Equation, is a partial differential equation that describes the dynamics of a quantum mechanics system using the wave function.

In this project, a numerical solution has been proposed to solve the 1-D Schrödinger’s Wave Equation for a user defined Energy Function using python. Further the idea has been extended to 2-D Wave Functions as well.
